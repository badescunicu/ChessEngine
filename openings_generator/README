In order to generate a database of openings:

1. You need a *.PGN file that includes the games upon which the output will be
created. If you want to get the database that was used for this project,
download ChessDB[1] and follow the steps from the link below[2], then load the
SCID database and export it as *.PGN[3].

2. Make sure that the moves are recorded using the UCI notation. If you followed
the step above, the algebraic notation will be used by default. You can use
pgn-extract[4] to make the conversion:

   $ ./pgn-extract -Wuci games_san.pgn > games_uci.pgn

3. Go into openings_generator.cpp and change MAX_DEPTH to the maximum number of
moves that you want to be stored for a game.

4. Compile openings_generator:

   $ make

   And launch it like this:

   $ ./openings_generator < games_uci.pgn

   It will create a binary file called output, that will store the database as a
tree (see NodeRecord in openings_generator.cpp).
